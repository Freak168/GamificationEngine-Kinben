## Gamification Engine - Kinben

The Gamification Engine Kinben is a RESTful service meant to support engineers adding gamified elements to existing or new processes. While it is up to you, WHAT kind of game-elements you are going to use, Kinben solves the HOW they are implemented for you. Kinben therefore works as a system of building bricks, ready to be set together to an individual gamification project.
This project was initially started by Interactive Systems working group at University of Duisburg-Essen as an open source project.
